# Pick-images-and-paste-them-on-a-final-image
This code will pick the png images present in the subfolders of the root_path you provided and will paste them on a final image that has a white background. You will have 1 final image of each subfolder present in its folder
You need just to modify the root_path according to your folder's directory.
I have created final images according to the Type 1 feature of Pokemon using the Pokemon Image Dataset shared [click here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishalsubbiah/pokemon-images-and-types)
